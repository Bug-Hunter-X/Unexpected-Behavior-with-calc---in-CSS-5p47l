The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, using it with multiple units can lead to unexpected results, especially if the units are not compatible. For example: `width: calc(50% + 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(50% + 10em);` may produce unexpected results because percentages and ems are relative to different base values.  Another common mistake is forgetting spaces around the operators in `calc()`, which results in a syntax error.  For example `width:calc(50%+10px)` is invalid.
